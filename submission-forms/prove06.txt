After completing the assignment, please answer the questions in this text file and submit it to I-Learn.

1. Copy and paste the URL for your web application:
http://secret-wildwood-23194.herokuapp.com/project1/app/


2. Copy and paste the URL for your source code repository (e.g., GitHub):
Here is the link for the application front end (in angular): https://github.com/clement-greg/cs313-php/tree/master/spelling-app
Here is the link for the API layer (in PHP): https://github.com/clement-greg/cs313-php/tree/master/web/project1


3. Briefly list and describe the elements of the application that are functioning. Include any special instructions about how to login and/or use your application.
CRUD operations completed for students, spelling lists, spelling words and scores
Quiz feature is completed
Breadcrumbs have been created for better navigation

*** Feel free to modify anything in the application (add/delete students, lists words scores), it is all test data ***


4. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.
I want the application to call a service that will retrieve dictionary definitions and present those definitions to the user.
I also want to use the browser text-to-speech API to allow the app to "Read" the word.
For some reason the application is redirecting from https to http, I think it has something to do with my .htaccess file.  I would like to 
fix it so that it doesn't redirect to http.


5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.
I created an SVG graphic that had css animations to give the presentation a little more pop.

6. What is a benefit of having a foreign key constraint?
It prevents the creation or alteration of bad data.  It will prevent saving a foreign key value into a table that does not exist in the source table.


7. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
1 - Some attempt was made
2 - Developing, but significantly deficient
3 - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
4 - Meets requirements
5 - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements
5


8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
A lot of work has gone into creating a design experience that matches the function of the application.
